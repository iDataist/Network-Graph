# Network-Graph
This project created and analyzed network graphs by NetworkX. Eight employees at a small company were asked to choose 3 movies that they would most enjoy watching for the upcoming company movie night. These choices are stored in the file [Employee_Movie_Choices.txt](https://github.com/iDataist/Network-Graph/blob/master/Employee_Movie_Choices.txt).A second file, [Employee_Relationships.txt](https://github.com/iDataist/Network-Graph/blob/master/Employee_Relationships.txt), has data on the relationships between different coworkers. The relationship score has value of `-100` (Enemies) to `+100` (Best Friends). A value of zero means the two employees haven't interacted or are indifferent. The results are presented in [Network_Graph.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Network-Graph/blob/master/Network_Graph.ipynb).
